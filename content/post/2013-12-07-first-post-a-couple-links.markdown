"O Muses, O high genius, aid me now!"Â 

-Inferno, Canto II 

  


While I've nothing interesting to say right now, I do have a few things to show you, a few tools I've found.  
  
If you use the "highlighter" function in a .pdf reader, you might find [this service](https://www.sumnotes.net/) helpful ([sumnotes.net](http://sumnotes.net/)); with a click, it copies all of the text you've highlighted and combines it into a single file. This is certainly nontrivial, and it took me a good half-an-hour to find.  
  
Also, if you want a quick _**LaTeX**_ compiler, check [this](http://mathurl.com/) out ([mathurl.com](http://mathurl.com/)). It creates a .png based on the input and keeps your output online so you can link to it. For instance, here's a generalized form of Euler's identity:

It is super handy; I'm not sure if it supports packages, but it's good to know about regardless. Both of these are completely free and a breeze to use.
