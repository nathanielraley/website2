In Fall 2018 I discovered that I enjoy [a certain kind of bar-style karaoke](www.karaokeunderground.com). Karaoke underground specializes in tracks from *relatively* obscure indie and punk artists, though there are a fair number of more popular jams. See here for the slowly growing [song list](www.karaoukeunderground.com/songlist). Below, I list the songs I have sung by date in chronological order.
