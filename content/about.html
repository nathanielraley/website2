<p>recreational mathematics, general knowledge trivia, and most fermented comestibles. If I were a nonhuman animal, I have it on good authority that I would be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_cockatoo#Gallery">umbrella cockatoo</a>.</p>

<p>In August 2017, I migrated my blog and personal website from blogger and AWS to GitHub/Netlify so I could blog more simply using the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown"><strong>blogdown</strong></a> package. This theme was adapted from <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme">Yihui Xie’s</a> adaptation of <a href="https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme">J. Rutheiser’s original</a></p>
