<p>Hello! My name is Nathaniel Woodward (<em>né</em> Raley).<br />
I am an educator, researcher, statistical consultant at UT Austin.</p>
<p>I love learning and I love learning about learning<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>—whether <em>in vivo, vitro,</em> or <em>silico</em>.</p>
<p>I am dedicated to optimizing human learning through psychological, biological, and technological cross-pollination.</p>
<!--My life's work is how life works
I believe that in addition to improving the quality and availability of education, an enduring love of learning should be the aim of every educator and the prerogative of every child. Further, I feel that urgent effort is needed to optimize student learning---increasing the efficacy of education will generate advancements at present unfathomable in the total amount of knowledge and truth in the world. Still more powerful pedagogies will result, fueling a feedback loop that will push our species onward and upward over critical thresholds in discovery. Only an optimally educated humanity will be equipped to solve today’s most pressing problems and to safeguard a future for our posterity

mechanics of memory

In both my teaching and my research, my guiding purpose is to improve students’ lifetime learning outcomes---to provide students with meaningful learning experiences that lead to durable, flexible knowledge; to show them how enjoyable learning can be so that they are motivated to pursue knowledge for its own sake; and to give them the cognitive and meta-cognitive skills they need to pursue their independent
inquiry effectively and efficiently.


Realize, though, that "living" and "learning" are mutually entailing and thus functionally equivalent: both terms imply changes in the state of a system with respect to its environment, given a unique history of such interactions.

Integrating over your every lesson-learned gives more than just what you know... it's who you are! A “tree of life” and a “tree of knowledge” have proverbial roots in most every culture, but if you dig beneath the surface you find that they grow together---like Baucis and Philemon of myth, or the great Pando of Utah, they are the same tree! (Some have preferred rhizome.) 

"you live and you learn." But this is tautological: to live is to learn!

<h1>Teaching</h1>
<p>Here is a platitude, but wait and I’ll unpack it: “To be a good teacher is to be a good student.”</p>
<p>For as long as I can remember, people have always asked me what I’m smiling about, and I’ve never known how to respond. Is my excitement shameful? Do I need an excuse for being happy? Like a rising tide, my unflagging positivity has always buoyed those around me. In middle school, I was voted “Friendliest” and in high school, my graduating class of almost 800 students crowned me “Class Clown” (see Figure 1). This unconscious aspect of my personality is still serving me well to this day. Here is a representative comment I received from a student on a course-instructor survey in 2015: “I never saw him without a big smile on his face. He was always eager to help out in class and enthusiastic when it came to explaining the material.”</p>
<p>Since that time, I have come to realize that my abiding good-cheer springs from a deep Love of Learning that infuses my every moment with excitement and personal meaning. When you love learning, life is transformed from a thing that happens to you into into a first-person quest for truth, beauty, and goodness: new experiences are mingled with old ones in the crucible of your imagination, producing ever-better mental models of reality, connecting previously unrelated ideas to form new patterns, new visions about the way things are… Once set aflame, this passion for personal truth is continually stoked by the small thrill of every realization and sustained by our profound need to bring order to ourselves and to the cosmos—the conviction that the universe will prove to make some final sense. A joy of learning suffuses life with meaning! It is the essence of education and the prerogative of every human being! We should all feel the tug of curiosity, the engulfing flow of discovery and problem-solving, the sheer awe of finally ``getting it.’’ Every little epiphany is worth its weight in gold; the final product of your every lesson-learned is far more what you know, it is who you are!</p>
<p>But if you are reading this, a lot of “life” has already happened to you: many formative experiences are now well in our past, and from them, relatively stable identities have emerged. Along the way, our schools and workplaces have communicated the view life is a series of repetitive, unenjoyable duties done grudgingly in exchange for material rewards or social status. But life is not about following directions, or even giving them; no, it is about making new directions, your own directions! To do this requires freeing one’s soul from the sedative cocoon of daily routines and instant gratification long enough to realize that there is still real mystery out in the world, still an infinitude of unrealized possibilities for your future self, still countless unanswered questions and fundamental problems that have become hidden underneath all the artificial cruft of modern life. The first task of an educator is to inspire students, to bring these timeless human issues and ultimate scientific questions into the light of day and to make a case for alternative lifestyles guided by such questions<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> (I leave them as an exercise for the reader). If these questions do not pull all students into their orbit, then at least they have raised awareness of human incompleteness and conflictedness: discontent and the awareness of alternatives is the starting-point of much meaningful intellectual activity! In the words of Allan Bloom,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The passions should be bound up in the glorious project of fulfilling human nature and searching for final truths, and this binding should be the goal of education.’’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Students who love to learn will seek meaning, truth, and enjoyment in everything they do—and they will find it.</p>
