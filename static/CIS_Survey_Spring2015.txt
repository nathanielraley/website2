1. N A
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. I could tell that Nathaniel was passionate about what we were talking about in the class. His feedback for all assignments was
helpful because he would fully explain a concept over again if he felt that our answer wasn't covering everything that theconcept
entailed. He was awesome!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Hands down the BEST teaching assistant I have ever had!  My experience at UT with TA's has been very negative.  They are usually
some stressed out grad student that has no desire to do anything more than the bare minimum. Nathaniel on the other handis so
wonderful!  I never saw him without a big smile on his face.  He was always eager to help out in class and enthusiastic when it
came to explaining the material.  I think what sets Nathanial apart from other TA's was how seriously he took his position.  He
did much of the grading of in class quizzes  PMEMS  and other assignments and would leave very detailed feedback.  This was so
helpful when it came to studying for exams!  He even left positive feedback on the questions I got right!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21. Nathaniel was great. He was one of my first TAs that I felt comfortable going to his office hours, he seemed to genuinely care
and was excited to help, which made me excited to learn. He took the time to try to understand my questions and give me the best
feedback possible which was very helpful. Overall I am very pleased with Nathaniel as my TA.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22. If Professor Butler quit teaching this course midway through the semester, I would want Nathaniel to be his replacement.
Nathaniel was very knowledgeable and helpful. And if you had a question you can bet your sweet ass Nathaniel knew the answer. I'm
pretty sure Nathaniel could teach this class on his own. I am really happy to have a TA like Nathaniel because most of my past
TA's confused me and would never really care about the students. Nathaniel cared and took the time for me when I needed help
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23. Nathaniel was extremely helpful. He is the most engaged TA I have had in my college career. He gave really extensive feedback and
it is clear that he took a lot of time to do so.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. Nathaniel was amazing. Extremely helpful and was the most engaging TA I have had in college. I really learned so much from him.

constructive and helpful. I feel lucky to have had such an amazing TA!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

favorite TAs. Would have liked to see him instructing more often.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26. Provided very helpful feedback when receiving assignment grades. Very approachable, along with the professor, and was a great
addition to the classroom dynamic, in my opinion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. Nathaniel provided very detailed feedback and suggestions for improving in the coarse.Hhe explained concepts clearly when
instructing. If I was a employer I would hire Nathaniel for a job.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28. Our teaching assistant Nathaniel looked really intent in his subject area and was knowledgeable in the area. He was responsive to
students' questions and he always gave me great feedbacks. I was really impressed by his prompt and considerate feedbacks on
every assignment and quizz because I haven't had that kind of concrete feedbacks back in Korea. Also, he has power of delivery in
that he gave us an understandable lecture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29. He has been one of the TA's Ive had. He always had a very upbeat attitude in class. He gave great tips on remembering certain
information. He gave great detailed feedback on my assignments. I could not have asked for a better help this semester.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30. You did really well at explaining concepts in simpler terms and making the subject matter relatable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31. Nathaniel was one of the best TA's I have ever had. He came to class everyday appearing happy to be there and enthusiastic about
the material. He gave great input during the lectures and always answered my questions thoughtfully and like he really cared that
i understood. He seemed very knowledgable. He always responded to any emails or questions quickly, and went above and beyond to
make sure I understood and could improve in the class. Giving feedback to any assignment, also! Between he and and the professor
it would have been completely my fault to not succeed. Which means they are great teachers! All I want to reiterate is that he
went above and beyond in his tasks and genuinely encouraged everyone in the class!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32. Nathaniel was always prompt with giving feedback on assignments. You could tell that he actually took out time to look through
assignments and tell what she be improved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
33. Nathaniel may be one of the hardest working TA's I've seen. Not only did he provide great effective and positive feedback on all
our assignments, he did so in a timely manner, which still amazes me even as I type this!! Great job Nathaniel!! Your knowledge
of the material and partnership with Andy was one that made the course not only effective, but fun as well!
