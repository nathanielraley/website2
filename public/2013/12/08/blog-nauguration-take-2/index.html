<h4 id="digital-citizenship-as-identity-formation"><strong>Digital Citizenship as Identity-formation </strong></h4>

<p>A few weeks ago, presaging (if not precipitating) my own entry into the blogosphere, I read a paper by Siles (2012) entitled &ldquo;<strong>Web Technologies of the Self: The Arising of the &ldquo;Blogger&rdquo; Identity</strong>.&rdquo; This article examines the emergence of <em>online diarists</em> and <em>bloggers</em> in the late 1990s through the lens of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucauldian_discourse_analysis">Foucauldian</a> &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_%28social_science%29">technologies of the self</a>&rdquo; by considering the role of websites as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_artifact">artifacts</a> in the process of self-formation online.</p>

<p>According to this author, a blog is a place where</p>

<blockquote>"random observations, selected links, and extended diatribes resolve into **a mosaic revealing personality, a self...** It is the writer's unique fusion of interests, enthusiasms, and prejudices---her personality---that makes a weblog compelling" (Blood, 2002a) </blockquote>

<p>There used to be a clear distinction between bloggers and online diarists that has all but disappeared today. Originally,  &ldquo;weblogs&rdquo; (or, after 1999, &ldquo;blogs&rdquo;) were just curated lists of  hyperlinks, often updated regularly&mdash;appended with helpful annotations,  recommendations, and reviews&mdash;and in reverse chronological order, with the newest content appearing at the top. Since their genesis, and particularly in their earlier instantiations, they appealed more to tech-savvy individuals who wanted a digital display-case for their favorite websites and geek-links, and while this is clearly a more exteriority-oriented  activity than the more inward-looking act of authoring a diary,  interviews by Siles (2012) revealed a common purpose. These are both places to &ldquo;respond to&rdquo;, &ldquo;comment on&rdquo;, or &ldquo;intervene in&rdquo; daily life, places for introspection, places where we can gain a new understanding of ourselves by divulging our inner world to others. Through these public, self-relevatory disclosures, we ourselves can be transformed.</p>

<p>Blogs, and to a lesser extent, online diaries, function as an online embodiment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomnema">hupomnemata</a>,  a material means by which to </p>

<blockquote>  
"capture the already-said, to collect what one has  managed to hear or read, and for a purpose that is nothing less than  the shaping of the self"" (Foucault, 1997, p. 211). </blockquote>

<p>This is my foremost motivation, the <em>fons et origo</em>, for blogging here. My hope is that, in telling some other (a generalized, inclusive &ldquo;other&rdquo;) who I am, I&rsquo;ll wind up telling myself who I am, and maybe then I&rsquo;ll try to act as though I am who I say I am. </p>

<blockquote>"Speaking aloud, as every lecturer  knows, often reveals implications (and particularly problems) in one's  own message that elude one when one engages in silent soliloquy" (Dennett, 1993).</blockquote>

<p>Because lately, who I am is socially inert. Complaisant by nature, recently married, and voluntarily friendless, there really isn&rsquo;t anyone left for me to try to impress. And neither is this some new development: to find any attempts on my part to impress, or to cultivate an &ldquo;impressive&rdquo; persona, you&rsquo;d have to look as far back as high school. And though it must have given me an edge in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_choice">mate choice</a> department 6 years ago (my choice chose me, and it&rsquo;s been perfect togetherness ever since), my need-to-impress has all but atrophied from disuse. Because why bother? I&rsquo;m set.</p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s taken some time, but I&rsquo;ve come to realize that this attitude is no good. Like it or not</p>

<blockquote>"[As human begins], our fundamental tactic of self-protection, self-control, and self-definition is not spinning webs or building dams, but telling stories, and more particularly concocting and controlling the story we tell others---and ourselves---about who we are... Our tales are spun, but for the most part we don't spin them; they spin us. Our human consciousness, and our narrative selfhood, is their product, not their source... These strings or streams of narrative issue forth as if from a single  source...their effect on any audience is to encourage them to (try to) posit a unified agent whose words they are, about whom they are" (Dennett 1993).</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use this blog to get to know myself better; sure, it sounds like a lot of cheese, but in time I&rsquo;ll be able to look at the running list of bunk I&rsquo;ve posted and what I&rsquo;ll see is a glorious constellation of my own features, features that my very personhood comprises (at least, that&rsquo;s the hope). Going forward, in an effort to impress the collective You (and no one in particular), I am going to start taking a little more pride in my appearance. At long last I have an audience, however illusory, for which to perform.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at it is, that if I keep this up, I will be able to look back and see how, in each post, I have embedded fundamental aspects of my identity-at-the-time. When we write, the millions of experiences we&rsquo;ve had since birth are brought to bear on the writing process, and so** the author leaves a residue**. Roswell and Pahl (2007) call this phenomenon &ldquo;sedimented identities in texts.&rdquo; If you accept the materialist premise of no souls, no homonculi, no ghosts in the machine, etc., then eventually you must acknowledge that</p>

<blockquote>"[Identities] are artifacts of the social processes that create us, and, like  other such artifacts, subject to sudden shifts in status. The only  "momentum" that accrues to the trajectory of a self is the stability  imparted to it by the web of beliefs that constitute it, and when those  beliefs lapse, it lapses, either permanently or temporarily (Dennet, 1993)</blockquote>
