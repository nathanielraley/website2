      <description>.table { margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 60%; text-align:center; }  Correlation People are often interested in how different variables are related to each other. In general, a correlation is just a relationship or association between two variables. If one variable gives you information about the other, then they are correlated (dependent, associated). More commonly, we talk about two variables having a linear relationship. To understand linear relationships, it helps to have a good grasp of variance and covariance.</description>
